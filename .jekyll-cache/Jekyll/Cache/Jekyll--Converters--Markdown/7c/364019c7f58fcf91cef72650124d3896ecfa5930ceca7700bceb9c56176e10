<div class="row pb-5">
	<div class="col-sm-8">
		<p>Currently, to collect science, operators program a linear sequence of behaviors and time them based on worst case. Goal based operations means the spacecraft has the flexibility to create a schedule using its knowledge of state. As a result the spacecraft has no flexibility to shuffle them around or lengthen or shorten times based on its environment.</p>

		<blockquote class="h1">	&ldquo;I donâ€™t want to have to call in [world expert on autonomy] to debug my spacecraft &rdquo; (paraphrased)</blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="col-sm-4">
		<p>The goal based paradigm has limited traction on JPL because of its complexity and unknown impact to operations. This limits exploration at far away targets and targets with rapidly changing environments, such as the Neptune System.</p>
		<p>Iâ€™m trying to understand the impact of and best practices for autonomy through prototyping and user studies.</p>

<h2 class="pt-5">Design Foundation</h2>
<div class="row pb-5">
	<div class="col-sm-8">
		<p> I led 2 workshops bring technologists and users together to imagine the new paradigm, one for uplink (send up commands telling the spacecraft what to do) and downlink (use data sent back from the spacecraft to analyze data and make sure the spacecraft behaved ok).  I prompted them with new situations they might encounter with autonomy and brainstormed impacts to processes and tooling. </p>
		<h3>Downlink Workshop</h3> - Identified need for autonomy engineer and phase for debugging spacecraft behavior. Given our time constraints, I conducted historical research to leverage existing work. Additional research identifies resource conflicts between scientists as the fundamental tension. Other design reports at JPL have discussed how siloed tools give limited visibility into changes that could impact the mission&lt;/p&gt;

		<p>I produced a set of tools and an operations framework based on the findings. We did not focus on polish at this stage, because we expected them to continue to evolve as a result of the study.</p>

			<li>Are operators given the right software tools and very rough draft ops con for modeling autonomous behaviors? </li>
			<li>During downlink, can operators understand enough about the autonomous decisions to ensure the health and safety of the spacecraft?</li>
			<li>Are operators able to conclude what happened onboard and why?</li>
			<li>Do operators understand the predicted outcome of their plan given the predictions of autonomous behaviors?â€¨</li>

		<p>In general, participants relied on the tools as we expected, confirming our workflow. We identified some opportunities for improvement and interesting user behavior.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>While low fidelity was helpful, we should explore the spectrum more to find the sweet spot</li>
			<li>Scientists who had a lower probability of observing their plume saw it as an overall loss</li>
			<li>The team used clusters of plans to structure their discussion</li>
