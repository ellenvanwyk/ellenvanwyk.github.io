timePeriod: 1 year
Roles: Lead designer
Responsibility1: Designed UX/UI for 2 analysis tools
Responsibility2: Built Clipper atomic research database with >2.4k atoms
Responsibility3: Led Clipper design system
Summary: I led design for a suite of tools for monitoring and troubleshooting Europa Clipperâ€™s performance, including DTAT (Downlink Trending and Analysis Toolkit) and State Manager (a tool for defining data so they can be shared and pulled into various visualizations). 

ProblemStatement: Operators use a wide variety of data both from the spacecraft and predictions they develop on earth to monitor, diagnose, prevent, and troubleshoot issues with health and safety onboard. However, the data is scattered across multiple domains and silos, and common visualizations are not supported by any shared tool.
